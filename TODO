Code gen:
* Generate tests for generated code.
* Generate benchmarks for generated code.
* Format and check the generated code compiles before writing the output.

Performance:
* performance is okay, but I haven't optimized anything.

Datastructures:
* Benchmark all the methods of the datastructures.
* Implement more things like:
   * Concurrent safe structures.
   * List.
   * Queue.
   * Caches (LRU, etc).
   * Graph.
   * Probabilistic structures.
